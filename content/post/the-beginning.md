I sincerely hope that this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website is--finally--the beginning of the blog I've been searching for a long time. Every year or so 'I feel it's time', but I'm am always detained by the boredom of the existing technology: neither I want to use log-in solutions such as *Wordpress*, nor I want to spend years writing html code, just to communicate a simple thought. 

#### Knots and the name of this blog...

Before becoming a PhD student, I spent a some time thinking about geometry and [knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory). 

Knots are closed curves embedded in the 3-dimensional sphere $
\mathbb{S}^3$, which is topologically equivalent to the usual 3-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^3$, but where there is an unseen point $\\{\*\\}$ where all ends meet. That is, no matter what direction you take, in the infinity you'll arrive to the same place.

Every knot can be visually represented with a [knot diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#Knot_diagrams). Below are three diagrams of my favourite knot: *the unknot*.

Although its formal mathematical definition it's not as simple as one would imagine, intuitively, the unknot is a lasso or circle, which is technically not a knot, but we like to think of it as the simplest knot. 

Surprisingly, recognising the unknot from a diagram is not a simple problem. In fact, it remains a major [unresolved issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknotting_problem) to determine if the problem admits a polynomial time solution! What I find fascinating about the unknot is that it shows yet again that simplicity is not easy to find. 

#### The Unknot and Science

In Academia, we tend to present the unknot as a line: although we could choose to do our Science in a more honest fashion--as the circle diagram--we like to be a little clever. So we draw our unknots as straight lines, and demand from the audience to visualise the point at infinity, so that we look somewhat smarter.

Real-world, on the other hand, is pretty tangled, and while the underlying truth is simple, finding it is not a polynomial time task. As practitioners, we spent years untangling diagrams, so that we arrive at the unknot in its circle form.

In this blog I will try to present the unknot as a circle, simple and beautiful as it is.

Anyways, I have a good feeling about this blog...
