### About me

<!-- Hi! I am an inquisitive Ph.D. student at UT Austin. Passionate for the art of mathematics and computers, I began my career tackling real-world problems with economic and financial data. Today, I seek to contribute to ongoing AI research from two perspectives: by developing scalable, parallelizable and decentralized algorithms, and by harnessing Probability and Statistics to provide insights and suggest smarter models. Please reach out if you want to collaborate.  -->

I am interested in statistical approaches to machine thinking and decision-making. My research interests lie at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Computational Linguistics. Currently, I work on scalable inference methods that enable the integration of advanced statistical methods such as Bayesian modeling with deep learning technologies. During my PhD I have also collaborated with researchers from other fields, such as transportation engineering, developing new scalable statisticalÂ methods for applied research.

Let's build more robust and secure AI together! See my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin-link] or [resume][resume-link] for more details about my skills and experience. Please reach out if you want to collaborate.
