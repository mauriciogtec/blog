### About me

<!-- Hi! I am an inquisitive Ph.D. student at UT Austin. Passionate for the art of mathematics and computers, I began my career tackling real-world problems with economic and financial data. Today, I seek to contribute to ongoing AI research from two perspectives: by developing scalable, parallelizable and decentralized algorithms, and by harnessing Probability and Statistics to provide insights and suggest smarter models. Please reach out if you want to collaborate.  -->

Let's build more robust and secure AI together! See my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin-link] or [resume][resume-link] for more details about my skills and experience. Please reach out if you want to collaborate.
